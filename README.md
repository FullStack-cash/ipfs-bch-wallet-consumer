# ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer

[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](http://standardjs.com) [![semantic-release](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20%20%F0%9F%93%A6%F0%9F%9A%80-semantic--release-e10079.svg)](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

This is a REST API server based on [Koa](https://koajs.com/). It's essentially a mirror image of [ipfs-bch-wallet-service](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-bch-wallet-service). Where ipfs-bch-wallet-service is intended to be coupled to [bch-api](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-api) to _provide_ blockchain service, ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer provides a localized REST API for _consuming_ that blockchain service.

When started, this web server starts an [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) node and connects to an ipfs-bch-wallet-service server over the IPFS network. It then pipes that connection over its own localized REST API.

## Requirements

- node **^14.18.2**
- npm **^8.3.0**
- Docker **^20.10.8**
- Docker Compose **^1.27.4**

## Installation

### Development Environment

**Note:** This software now uses an external go-ipfs IPFS node. The instructions below have not been updated to reflect this.

A development environment will allow you modify the code on-the-fly and contribute to the code base of this repository. [PM2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) is recommended for running this code base as an IPFS Circuit Relay.

- [Step-by-step installation instructions](https://gist.github.com/christroutner/3304a71d4c12a3a3e1664a438f64d9d0)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-service-provider
cd ipfs-service-provider
./install-mongo-sh
sudo npm install -g node-pre-gyp
npm install
./ipfs-service-provider.sh
```

### Production Environment

The [docker](./production/docker) directory contains a Dockerfile for building a production deployment.

```
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

You can bring the containers back up with `docker-compose up -d`.

### Operation Notes

- There is a memory leak in the version of js-ipfs. The app is currently configured to shut down every 8 hours to flush memory. It relies on a process manager like pm2, Docker, or systemd to restart the app after it shuts down, in order to ensure continuous operation.

- The PSF network operates as a private network. It does not connect or interact with the wider PSF network, relying instead on gateways to bridge the two networks, when they need to share content. This improves the performance and experience for everyone in the PSF network. To join the network, you'll need to add the [swarm.key](./swarm.key) file to the IPFS data folder.

- [Instructions on setting up IPFS private networks.](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/experimental-features.md#private-networks)
- For external installations, the swarm.key file will typically go in `~/.ipfs/swarm.key`
- For production Docker containers, the key would go in `ipfs-service-provider/production/data/go-ipfs/data/swarm.key`

## Structure

The file layout of this repository differs from the koa-api-boilerplate. Instead, it follows the file layout of [Clean Architecture](troutsblog.com/blog/clean-architecture).

## Usage

- `npm start` Start server on live mode
- `npm run docs` Generate API documentation
- `npm test` Run mocha tests
- `docker-compose build` Build a 'production' Docker container
- `docker-compose up` Run the docker container

## Documentation

API documentation is written inline and generated by [apidoc](http://apidocjs.com/).
